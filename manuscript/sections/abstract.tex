%Rumor defeating in a fully automated way is a meaningful task for reducing the hazards of rumors in social networks.
Fully automated rumor defeating is meaningful for reducing hazards of misinformation in social networks.
As one of the automated approaches, content-based rumor defeating is a pipeline that could be divided into four sequential sub-tasks: detection, tracking, sentence classification, and veracity. 
Specifically, rumor tracking gathers relevant posts and filters irrelevant posts for a potential rumor news, which is a significant component for rumor defeating and has not been studied extensively. However, the existing proposals only consider rumor tracking as an auxiliary task in multi-task learning without special optimization, therefore restraining the accuracy of tracking performance. 
To this end, we propose an aggregated model for rumor tracking, namely ART. 
\textcolor{blue}{By adopting multiple components for different tweets features, we improve the tracking accuracy.}
Finally, we conduct experiments on public datasets and the experimental results show the superiority of ART on efficiency and effectiveness.
