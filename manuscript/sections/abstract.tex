Rumor defeating in a fully automated way is a meaningful task for reducing the hazards of rumors in social networks. Usually, content-based rumor defeating is a pipeline task that could be divided into four sub-tasks: detection, tracking, stance classification, and veracity. Compared to the other three sub-tasks, rare studies are dedicated to rumor tracking.  Rumor tracking in social networks is an important sub-task in rumor defeating, which gathers the relevant posts and filters the irrelevant posts for a given rumor news. SOTA work treats rumor tracking as an auxiliary task in multi-task learning and lacks special optimization for it, which limits the accuracy of tracking performance. Consequently, we propose a model for rumor tracking specifically. By adopting xx, we improve the tracing accuracy. Finally, we conduct experiments on public datasets and the experimental results shows the superior of xxx.
