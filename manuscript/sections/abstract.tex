Rumor defeating in a fully automated way is a meaningful task for reducing the hazards of rumors in social networks. Usually, content-based rumor defeating is a pipeline task that could be divided into four sub-tasks: detection, tracking, stance classification, and veracity. Compared to the other three sub-tasks, rare studies are dedicated to rumor tracking.  Rumor tracking in social networks is an important sub-task in rumor defeating, which gathers the relevant posts and filters the irrelevant posts for a given rumor news. SOTA work treats rumor tracking as an auxiliary task in multi-task learning and lacks special optimization for it, which limits the accuracy of tracking performance. Consequently, we propose an aggregated model for rumor tracking specifically named ART. By adopting multiple components for different tweets features, we improve the tracking accuracy. Finally, we conduct experiments on public datasets and the experimental results shows the superior of ART on efficiency and effectiveness.
