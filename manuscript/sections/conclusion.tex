\label{sec:conclusion}
Rumor Tracking is a valuable sub-task of automatically rumor defeating. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning based model xxxx.  By choosing specific features for rumors and adopting advanced embedding method. We promote the F1-score on rumor tracking task. Also, well-designed experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of xxxx. Experimental results on benchmark datasets suggest that our model leads the baseline methods by over 5\% on average. In the feature, we will explore more efficient features for rumor detection, such as the links between users.
