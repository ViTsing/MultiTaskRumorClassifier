Rumor Tracking is a valuable sub-task of automatically rumor defeating. In this paper, we propose an aggregated model named ART.  By adding specific features for rumor tracking and adopting voting based aggregating strategy. We promote the performance of rumor tracking task on accuracy and F1-score. Also, well-designed experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of ART. Experimental results on benchmark datasets suggest that our model leads the baseline methods by over 5\% on average. In the feature, we will explore more efficient features for rumor detection, such as the links between users. Besides, we will explore a weighted voting strategy to optimize the aggregation. For instance, the weights can be learned from reinforcement learning on rumor sequence.
