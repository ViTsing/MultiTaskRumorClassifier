Rumor Tracking is a valuable sub-task of automatically rumor defeating. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based bagging model named RL-BRT. By adding specific features for rumor tracking and adopting a weight-tuning policy network (WTPN) based bagging strategy. We promote the performance of the rumor tracking task on accuracy and macro-F1 score. Besides, well-designed experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-BRT. Experimental results on benchmark datasets suggest that our model outperforms the baseline methods by over 5\% on average. In the feature, we will explore more efficient features for rumor detection, such as the links between users. Moreover, we consider utilizing the topology of social networks to promote the performance of rumor classifier.
